# Reproducibility and Compliance
  Tweet text and user location are not redistributed to comply with Twitter/X Terms of Service (TOS) and privacy policies. Only Tweet IDs and derived labels are      shared.
  ## Researchers wishing to reproduce the results must:
    1) Hydrate the Tweet IDs using their own Twitter API credentials.
    2) Follow the processing pipeline described below.

# Input Datasets
  1) Twitter_dataset.xlsx: Contains 42,567 Tweet_IDs used in the study.
  2) finaldata.xlsx: Contains commonly occurring city names, state/province names, and other location strings for each of the ten countries analyzed in the       manuscript.
  3) Country_dataset.xlsx: Contains country-wise COVID-19 cases, deaths, and population data.

# Processing Pipeline
  **Step 1:**  
 	  Tweet_IDs in Twitter_dataset.xlsx are hydrated using the Twitter API to retrieve Tweet Text and Location fields. The hydrated outputs are stored in a Google        Sheet.  
  **Step 2:**  
 	  Run Final_code_for_publication_1.ipynb. This notebook applies the Twitter-roBERTa-base sentiment analysis model to hydrated tweets.  
      - **pred_label** corresponds to **local sentiment**  
      - **final_tweet_logit** corresponds to the **Sentiment Score (SC)** defined in the manuscript  
  **Step 3:**  
 	  Run Final_code_for_publication_2.ipynb. This notebook executes the Bayesian Multilevel Ordinal Regression (BMOR) model.  
  **Step 4:**  
 	  Run Final_code_for_publication_3.ipynb. This notebook implements Method 1 and Method 2 proposed in the manuscript. Additionally, the following baseline models      are applied to the generated global sentiment labels:  
      - Logistic Regression  
      - Random Forest  
      - Multinomial Naive Bayes  
      - Bernoulli Naive Bayes

# Output Datasets
  1) Local_Sentiment_Label.xlsx: Contains local sentiment labels (pred_label) for 42,567 tweets.
  2) Global_Sentiment_Label.xlsx: Contains global sentiment labels for 19,622 tweets generated using the proposed methods described in the manuscript.  
    - **Field Correspondence :**
      - **final_sentiment:** Global sentiment labels generated by Method 1
      - **original_sentiment:** Global sentiment labels generated by Method 2
      - **intensity_label_mean:** Global sentiment labels generated by the BMOR model
